In R, a variable is a name used in source code to reference a storage location in the computer's memory. We can create a variable by writing the name of the variable followed by an assignment operator (<code>&lt;-</code> or <code>=</code>) and then the value we want to store in that variable. If we use the variable name later in our code, R will replace it with the value we assigned to it. In the example below, we create a variable called `age` and assign it the value `25`. When we print the value of `age`, R outputs `[1] 25`.

<r-cell>age &lt;- 25
print(age)
</r-cell>

<h2>Variable Naming Rules</h2>
    
When naming variables in R, there are a few important rules to follow:
<ul>
    <li>Variable names can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_) or periods (.).</li>
    <li>Variable names cannot start with a number or a period followed by a number. For example, <code>1st_place</code> is not a valid variable name.</li>
    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that <code>age</code>, <code>Age</code>, and <code>AGE</code> are considered different variables.</li>
    <li>Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters (except underscores and periods).</li>
</ul>

In addition, variables should not use R reserved words (keywords), as these have special meanings in the language. These include:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>if</code></td>
        <td><code>else</code></td>
        <td><code>for</code></td>
        <td><code>while</code></td>
        <td><code>repeat</code></td>
        <td><code>break</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>next</code></td>
        <td><code>function</code></td>
        <td><code>return</code></td>
        <td><code>in</code></td>
        <td><code>TRUE</code></td>
        <td><code>FALSE</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>NULL</code></td>
        <td><code>NA</code></td>
        <td><code>NaN</code></td>
        <td><code>Inf</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;-</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;&lt;-</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Variable Name Clashes</h2>

Although the prohibition of reserved words helps avoid some naming conflicts, it is still possible to accidentally overwrite important built-in functions or objects by using the same name for a variable. For example, if we create a variable called <code>print</code>, our variable will hide (or "shadow") the built-in <code>print</code> function, and we will no longer be able to use it until we delete our variable. For example, the code cell below shows what happens when we create a variable called <code>print</code> and then try to use the <code>print</code> function.

<r-cell>print &lt;- "Hello, World!"  # This creates a variable called 'print'
print(10)  # This will cause an error
</r-cell>

You should have seen an error message indicating that the `print` function cannot print a character string in this context. This is because R is trying to use our variable `print` (which is a character string) instead of the built-in `print` function. Reload the page to reset the environment and remove the variable.

To avoid such issues, it is a good practice to choose variable names that are unlikely to clash with built-in function names.

<h2>Variables and Expressions</h2>

If the code on the right-hand side of the assignment operator is an expression, R will first evaluate the expression and then assign the resulting value to the variable. For example, in the code below, we create a variable called <code>x</code> and assign it the result of the expression <code>5 + 3</code>. R evaluates the expression to get <code>8</code>, and then assigns that value to <code>x</code>. When we print the value of <code>x</code>, R outputs `[1] 8`.

<r-cell>x &lt;- 5 + 3
print(x)
</r-cell>

<h2>Changing Variable Values</h2>

We can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. For example, in the code below, we first create a variable called `count` and assign it the value `10`. We then change the value of `count` to `20` by assigning a new value to it. When we print the value of `count`, R outputs `[1] 20`.

<r-cell>count &lt;- 10
count &lt;- 20
print(count)
</r-cell>
